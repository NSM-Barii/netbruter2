================================================================================
OPERATIONAL NOTES:
================================================================================

RECONNAISSANCE PRIORITY:
1. Scan all Tier 1 targets for open services, vulnerable web apps
2. Focus on web interfaces (80/443), email (25/587/993), VPN (443/1194)
3. Look for outdated software, unpatched CVEs, weak authentication
4. OSINT: LinkedIn for employee info, GitHub for leaked credentials
5. Subdomain enumeration: many orgs use predictable patterns

LIKELY VULNERABILITIES:
- Legacy Windows systems (SMB, RDP) - Iran has poor patch management
- Outdated web frameworks (PHP, Apache) - common in government sites
- Weak passwords - Persian language passwords, default credentials
- SQL injection - widespread in Iranian web applications
- Exposed admin panels - /admin, /cpanel, /manager often unprotected

DEFENSIVE CONSIDERATIONS:
- Expect IDS/IPS on Tier 1 targets (Presidential, IRGC, Cyber)
- Rate limiting likely on government sites
- Some networks may have airgaps (nuclear facilities)
- Chinese/Russian security equipment common (Huawei, Kaspersky)
- Mobile networks use European gear (Nokia, Ericsson) - well documented

INTELLIGENCE COLLECTION:
- Document all findings: services, versions, responses
- Screenshot login pages, capture banners
- Note IP ranges, subdomains, email addresses
- Build network maps showing relationships between ASNs
- Geolocate infrastructure (datacenters, offices, facilities)

LEGAL/ETHICAL WARNINGS:
- Unauthorized access is illegal in most jurisdictions
- Iran actively prosecutes cyber attacks as acts of war
- Consider targeting civilian vs military infrastructure carefully
- Document everything for attribution/legal protection
- Understand rules of engagement for your specific authorization

COUNTER-INTELLIGENCE RISKS:
- Iran monitors for reconnaissance activity
- Honeypots likely deployed on sensitive networks
- Attribution via IP, tools, TTPs - use proper OPSEC
- IRGC Cyber Command actively hunts foreign intelligence
- Expect retaliation if detected

ASN TO IP RANGE CONVERSION:
================================================================================

To get IP ranges for these ASNs, use one of these methods:

1. BGP Looking Glass Services:
   - https://bgp.he.net/AS[NUMBER]
   - Example: https://bgp.he.net/AS34592

2. WHOIS Queries:
   - whois -h whois.radb.net AS[NUMBER]
   - Example: whois -h whois.radb.net AS34592

3. RIPEstat:
   - https://stat.ripe.net/AS[NUMBER]

4. Automated Tools:
   - `asnmap -a AS[NUMBER]` (ASNmap tool)
   - `whob AS[NUMBER]` (Whois bulk tool)

5. APIs:
   - RIPE NCC API: https://stat.ripe.net/data/announced-prefixes/data.json?resource=AS[NUMBER]
